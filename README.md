## 🎯 Course Overview

This course focused on creating and managing **NoSQL databases** using **MongoDB** and the **Mongoose ODM**. I built secure, database-driven applications with user authentication, Express servers, and React front ends.

Topics included:
- Building and querying MongoDB databases  
- Using Mongoose for data modeling and validation  
- Creating RESTful APIs with Express.js  
- Developing front-end interfaces with React  
- Implementing secure authentication and authorization  
- Designing full-stack apps using the MERN stack

## 🧪 Capstone Project: **Climate Action 101**

A full-stack MERN web app designed to raise awareness on political and climate issues. Users can sign up, log in, and post issues, then upvote or downvote them.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ User authentication and secure login/logout  
- ✅ CRUD operations for political issue posts  
- ✅ Voting system with upvote/downvote  
- ✅ MongoDB persistence via Mongoose  
- ✅ Responsive front-end built with React  
- ✅ Express.js RESTful API backend

**Development Highlights**:
- Part 1: Backend setup and database schema design  
- Part 2: API endpoints and secure routing  
- Part 3: Front-end development with authentication logic  
- Part 4: UX enhancements and styling  
- Part 5: Final testing and deployment preparation
